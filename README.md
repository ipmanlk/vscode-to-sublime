_Guide on setting up Sublime Text 4 to be similar to VS Code_

## Initial Steps

1. **Install Package Control.**
   This is essential for managing packages (similar to extensions in VS Code).

   Explore all packages and their descriptions [here](https://packagecontrol.io/).

2. **Tools -> Command Palette is your friend!**
   Access all commands similarly to VSCode by searching "Package Control" in the command palette.

## Appearance

1. **Install a sleek theme:**
   I recommend "Theme - One," "Ayu," or "Material Theme."

   Set your theme by searching "UI: Select Theme" and "UI: Select Color Scheme" for syntax themes.
